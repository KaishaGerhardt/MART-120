                         Its simple, just "chop" or "not" to set yourself up for a date with some a woody perennial plant,<br/>
                         typically having a single stem or trunk growing to a considerable height and bearing lateral branches
                         at some distance from the ground.

                         This is a little movie of a ghost, skeleton and a bat showing us that its never too early to celebrate Halloween (spooky time)<br />
                         The ghost becomes desperate and decides to scare early and spook the young teen by telling her the scary things that life has to offer.

                         Here is me, Kaisha, as a Picasso Mona Lisa with some action! I really liked how it came out and super very expressive!

                         <br />
                          The Game is little off-brand Pac Man needs to get to the exit but must avoid the ghosts and the growing flower in the middle - its follows you.
                         <br/>
                         I struggled at some points but I think the game looks good. Its definintely something that can be imporved over time.
