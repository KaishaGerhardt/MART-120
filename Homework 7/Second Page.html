    <h3> TIME</h3>
    <tbody>
        Watching the clock is a waste of time
        <br />
        I continuously watch the clock take time away
        <br />
        It sometimes feels like forever or now recently, too fast
        <br />
        Wishing that things would go by fast is something that should not be wished for
        <br />
        For pain, yes
        <br />
        For growing up, no
        <br />
        I’m eager to grow and leave but it scares me how fast it happened
        <br />
        It seems that I was just a little girl wanting to run away a few days ago
        <br />
        Now I'm an adult still wanting to run away, but for different reasons now
        <br />
        Just looking back, it's strange to think I've lived this long
        <br />
        I felt that I would have died a long time ago
        <br />
        But no
        <br />
        I'm surprisingly still here
        <br />
        And still watching the clock
        <br />
        Tick and ticking away
        <br />
        Minutes
        <br />
        Hours
        <br />
        Days
        <br />
        Months
        <br />
        Years
        <br />
        Of my life.

    </tbody> The Thoughts From Her
    <br />
    There she is, the not yet bloomed tree in a forest full of tall strong cherry blossom trees
    <br />
    The feeling of insecurity, as a red rabbit feels the endangerment of standing in a snowy plane….alone.
    <br />
    But she tricks her mind as a hypnotist tricks his clients
    <br />
    To believe she is a dictator of confidence.
    <br />
    She starts to express many thoughts
    <br />
    From that she works off, working in her mind day and night with only in a few minutes
    <br />
    She has waterfalls of thoughts
    <br />
    ...some too harsh and some too soft to speak…
    <br />
    She turns to the one thought she knows all too well
    …..Herself…..
    <br />
    Yet she is a stranger at the same
    <br />
    She writes as a typewriter types, collecting what to produce next.
    <br />
    Therefore time slips from the clock wiping it clean of the past.
    <br />
    She stands as the unblossomed tree
    <br />
    Prepares to speak, the birds in her mind chirp
    <br />
    So here I am speaking my chirp before you
    <br />
    All blossomed cherry trees
    <br />
